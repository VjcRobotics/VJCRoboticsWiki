> [!TIP] QUIK TIPS
> - Please use a pen or marker than doesn't scratch the foam
> - Gently drag your pen/marker without applying force or the pen will tear the foam and build quality will be bad

## Guidelines for the Penknife

- Please be extra careful as these penknifes are ever sharper than the regular ones.
- angle the penknife close to the foam

- Smoothly cut and be extra careful around bends

## 45 degree cuts

- Some parts of the plane may require 45 degree cuts
- This can be achieved using a table edge that is rounded.Simple align the blade to the table edge and slide. Try to cut as smoothly as possible

## Adhesives

### UHU Por

- Some portions of the plane may require gluing. For _foam-to-foam connections_ [UHU Por](Adhesives.md#^2de2c6) is mostly sufficient

- This applies to all adhesives, do not apply more than you will need.
>[!TIP] TIP
>Suppose there are gaps in your joints, you cut tiny pieces of foam and mix them with a little bit of UHU Por and fill gaps.

### CA Glue + Epoxy

- [CA Glue](Adhesives.md#^321b04) + Epoxy is used for [Carbon Rods](Aeromodelling.md#^7e8dea) to foam connections and other connections that require high strength

#### Steps

1. Add Ca glue to the joint. CA Glue is basically like superglue![[Pasted image 20241021185702.png]]

2. Add [Kicker](Adhesives.md#^a4f58b) to the area with the joint. Kicker the purple colored bottle. Avoid using the spray as it will make everything sticky. Instead use the tube at the bottom of the spray to drip some kicker onto the joint. Kicker will make the CA glue bond better and stronger.![[Pasted image 20241021185718.png]]
    
3. Mix up some [Epoxy](Adhesives.md#^975aeb). The current epoxy we are using is quick epoxy and dries within 10 minutes. Therefore, do not mix too much. Use a foam piece or toothpick to mix. Mix Parts A and B together. 

> [!WARNING] WARNING
> Do not mix up the caps placed on top as it can cause the bottle to be sealed permanently. They are usually different colours. Be careful about this as epoxy is expensive

4. Mix in a 1:1 ratio(for ZAP Epoxy brand(read instructions on tube or box)). Use a toothpick or foam bit to put the epoxy on the joint. Please wait for the epoxy to dry before putting stress on the joint.
